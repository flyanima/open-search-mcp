# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

Open Search MCP takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and security guidelines for users and contributors.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@your-domain.com] (replace with actual email)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use PGP key [KEY_ID] for sensitive reports

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### API Key Protection

- **Environment Variables**: All API keys must be stored in environment variables
- **No Hardcoding**: Never hardcode API keys in source code
- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys
- **Monitoring**: Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity

### Input Validation

- **Schema Validation**: All inputs are validated against strict schemas
- **Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: API calls are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **Size Limits**: Request payloads have size limitations

### Container Security

- **Non-root User**: Containers run as non-root user (UID 1000)
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Containers use read-only filesystems where possible
- **No New Privileges**: Security option `no-new-privileges:true` is enabled
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Only necessary ports are exposed

### Network Security

- **Restricted Networks**: Docker networks use specific subnets
- **Internal Communication**: Services communicate over internal networks
- **TLS Encryption**: All external communications use TLS
- **CORS Protection**: Strict CORS policies are enforced

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Required security-related environment variables:

```bash
# Session and JWT secrets (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)
SESSION_SECRET=your_very_long_random_session_secret_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key_here

# Docker deployment secrets
SEARXNG_SECRET=your_very_long_searx_secret_key_here
GRAFANA_PASSWORD=your_secure_grafana_password_here
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password_here

# CORS and security headers
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
CSP_ENABLED=true
```

### Docker Security

Apply these security configurations to all containers:

```yaml
security_opt:
  - no-new-privileges:true
user: "1000:1000"
read_only: true
tmpfs:
  - /tmp:noexec,nosuid,size=100m
```

## üìã Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] All API keys are stored in environment variables
- [ ] Default passwords have been changed
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] CORS origins are restricted
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled
- [ ] Logging is configured securely
- [ ] Container security options are applied
- [ ] Network access is restricted
- [ ] TLS certificates are valid
- [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities are scanned

### Regular Maintenance

- [ ] API keys are rotated quarterly
- [ ] Dependencies are updated monthly
- [ ] Security logs are reviewed weekly
- [ ] Access permissions are audited monthly
- [ ] Backup encryption keys are tested
- [ ] Incident response plan is updated

## üö´ Security Anti-Patterns

### What NOT to Do

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Don't use default passwords** in production
- **Avoid running containers as root**
- **Don't disable security features** for convenience
- **Never log sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Don't ignore security warnings** from dependencies
- **Avoid overly permissive CORS** settings

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Logging

Security-relevant events that are logged:

- Authentication attempts
- API key usage
- Rate limit violations
- Input validation failures
- Container security events
- Network access attempts

### Alerting

Set up alerts for:

- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Container security violations
- High error rates
- Suspicious network activity

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools

### Recommended Tools

- **Dependency Scanning**: `npm audit`, Snyk, or GitHub Dependabot
- **Container Scanning**: Docker Scout, Trivy, or Clair
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint security plugins, SonarQube
- **Runtime Protection**: Falco for container runtime security
- **Secret Scanning**: GitLeaks, TruffleHog

### Security Testing

Regular security testing should include:

- Dependency vulnerability scans
- Container image scans
- Static code analysis
- Input validation testing
- Authentication testing
- Authorization testing
