Maximize your productivity with Open-Search-MCP using these proven strategies and tips.

## üöÄ Getting the Most Out of Open-Search-MCP

### 1. Choose the Right Tool for the Job

#### Academic Research
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Specific and targeted
"Search for 'transformer architecture' papers on arXiv from 2023"

# ‚ùå Avoid: Too broad
"Search for AI papers"
```

#### Code Search
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Include language and context
"Find React hooks examples for form validation on GitHub"

# ‚ùå Avoid: Vague queries
"Find code examples"
```

#### Web Research
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Specific URLs and purpose
"Crawl https://example.com/blog and extract main content"

# ‚ùå Avoid: Generic crawling
"Crawl some websites"
```

### 2. Use Multi-Source Research Effectively

#### Intelligent Research
```bash
# ‚úÖ Excellent: Comprehensive approach
"Research 'quantum computing applications in cryptography' using arXiv, GitHub, and Stack Overflow"

# ‚úÖ Good: Specific domain focus
"Find information about React performance optimization from GitHub repos and Stack Overflow discussions"
```

#### Deep Research
```bash
# ‚úÖ Perfect for complex topics
"Perform deep research on 'sustainable energy storage solutions' with iterative refinement"
```

## üîß Configuration Best Practices

### API Key Management

#### Environment Variables (Recommended)
```bash
# Create a .env file in your project root
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_key_here

# Load in your shell profile
source .env
```

#### Security Best Practices
```bash
# ‚úÖ Do: Use environment variables
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"

# ‚ùå Don't: Hardcode in configuration files
{
  "env": {
    "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_your_actual_token_here"  // Never do this!
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Optimization

#### Claude Desktop
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-search-mcp": {
      "timeout": 60,  // Reasonable timeout
      "env": {
        "MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS": "3"  // Prevent overwhelming
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor IDE (with Cline)
```json
{
  "autoApprove": [
    "search_arxiv",
    "search_github",
    "search_stackoverflow",
    "intelligent_research"
  ]  // Pre-approve safe tools
}
```

#### Windsurf (HTTP Mode)
```bash
# Start with appropriate resources
MCP_HTTP_PORT=8000 MCP_MAX_CONNECTIONS=50 npm run server:http
```

#### Augment Code (WebSocket Mode)
```bash
# Optimize for real-time performance
MCP_WS_PORT=8001 MCP_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=30000 npm run server:websocket
```

## üìä Performance Optimization

### 1. Request Patterns

#### Efficient Querying
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Specific and focused
"Search for 'React useEffect cleanup' on Stack Overflow"

# ‚úÖ Better: Include context
"Find React useEffect cleanup patterns for memory leak prevention on Stack Overflow"

# ‚ùå Avoid: Multiple broad queries in sequence
"Search for React"
"Search for useEffect"  
"Search for cleanup"
```

#### Batch Operations
```bash
# ‚úÖ Excellent: Single comprehensive request
"Crawl these URLs and summarize content: [url1, url2, url3]"

# ‚ùå Avoid: Multiple individual requests
"Crawl url1"
"Crawl url2"
"Crawl url3"
```

### 2. Caching Strategy

#### Leverage Built-in Caching
```bash
# Results are cached for 1 hour by default
# Repeated queries return instantly

# ‚úÖ Good: Ask follow-up questions about same topic
"Search for 'machine learning' papers on arXiv"
"From those machine learning papers, which focus on neural networks?"
```

#### Cache Configuration
```bash
# Adjust cache TTL for your workflow
export CACHE_TTL=7200  # 2 hours for research sessions
export CACHE_TTL=1800  # 30 minutes for development
```

### 3. Rate Limit Management

#### API Token Benefits
```bash
# Without GitHub token: 60 requests/hour
# With GitHub token: 5000 requests/hour

# ‚úÖ Always use tokens for heavy usage
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
```

#### Smart Request Timing
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Space out requests naturally
"Search for React tutorials on GitHub"
# ... review results ...
"Find advanced React patterns on Stack Overflow"

# ‚ùå Avoid: Rapid-fire requests
# Multiple searches in quick succession
```

## üé® Workflow Integration
